 0.11.0		Added functions for deleted entries.
 		You can now search for deleted entries.
 		Deleted entries will get two additional buttons in the result list.
 		The first one simply undeletes the entry.
 		The second one undeletes the entry and opens a backend form to edit the undeleted entry.
 		After saving you will return to the result listing you called the editing form from.
 		Added corresponding language labels.
 		Fixed some bugs.

 0.10.1		Added Danish translation. (Thanx to Peter Klein)

 0.10.0		Fixed some minor bugs.
		Added locallang settings to make the module aware of BE user language settings. (Thanx to Paolo Cojazzi)
		Currently there are English, German and Italian settings available.
		Feel free to translate other languages and send me your translations via PM.

 0.9.1		Added processed fieldnames as header for the CSV output.
		Added User- and Group-TSconfig values to enable/disable parts of the form.
		advBESearch {
		  disableTopCheckboxes = 1
		  disableStoreControl = 1
		  disableSelectATable = 1
		  disableSelectFields = 1
		  disableGroupBy = 1
		  disableOrderBy = 1
		  disableLimit = 1
		  disableShowSQLQuery = 1
		}

 0.9.0		Added another hook to insert stuff before the result table.
		Added some buttons for browsing results by setting the limit and submitting the form via JacaScript.
		Labels of the result table are now displayed correctly when selecting "use formatted strings".

 0.8.5		Fixed a bug with an infinite loop occurring when DB relation fields are related to more than one table.

 0.8.4		Inserted a checkbox to switch the sorting of options in selectboxes from value to label.
		Replaced while loops using foreach instead for better performance with long loops.

 0.8.3		Fixed a a bug with the disable brackets checkbox that forced the user to refresh in order to remove the brackets.

 0.8.2		Added support for the TCA ctrl "label_alt" in result lists.
		Added a checkbox to disable the use of original values in brackets as prefix for labelled results..

 0.8.1		Fixed some bugs with datetime, time and date recognition.

 0.8.0		Added support for the TCA ctrl "label_alt" so that entries in selectboxes are labelled correctly if the original label field is empty.

 0.7.1		Fixed a bug with date fields displayed as datettimefields in querymaker and results

 0.7.0		Added the possibility to use hooks inside the queryMaker.
		Added a first hook for additional Buttons in the result row display.
		This way the user can create additional Buttons like "create new related record" and have them prefilled with values taken from the result.
                                Example: When displaying results from fe_users in situtations you might want to assign the user as owner for different new entries in other tables as well.

 0.6.3		Fixed a bug with selected values not marked as selected anymore.
		Added DB-mounts in the taskcenter for result lists of non admin users.
		Added the checkbox setting for labelled results to the edit query link in the taskcenter.
		Removed some unnecessary <br /> tags from the result list.

 0.6.2		Fixed a bug with a surplus use of getPagePermsClause for non admin users.
		Selectboxes and results for DB relations will now be labelled correctly as long as the related record is inside the DB-mounts of the BE-user.

 0.6.1		Fixed a bug with missing function getTreeList for non admin users.

 		Changed the "Save to action" behaviour so that only admin users can save to actions while non admin users can only save inside their session.
 		The actions in the Taskcenter will still be available for everybody.

 0.6.0		Added a replacement class to make search queries available as actions in the user task center.
 		This will replace the original query-action based on the DB check extension.
 		Simply create an action in the root of your website, then create a query and save it to the action. This way you can assign predefined queries to different users and groups.
 		Be sure to install the complete taskcenter and especially sys_action first if you want to use it.
 		If you installed Advanced Searchform before sys_actions you will have to remove it and reinstall it to make sure it overrides the sys_action class.
 		The Searchform itself will still work without the taskcenter of course .

 0.5.1		Fixed a bug with table relations and selectboxes not correctly labelled when checking the "use formatted" checkbox 
 		and the field value is not an integer but alphanumeric.

 0.5.0		Better performance due to reduced number of SELECT querys.
 		If a related table is used more than once during the SELECT the values are taken form a prefilled array instead.
 		Additional checkbox to enable formatted output of labels, strings and dates instead of original values in search and export results.
 		This way values from query generator can be used in results too.

 0.4.2		Fixed a bug with table relations not working for admin users anymore.

 0.4.1		Fixed a bug with table relations, where the related table has no "delete" field.

 0.4.0		Changed checkbox behaviour from boolean/multiple to boolean/binary.
		Binary is using "equals/does not equal" and "contains/does not contain" only.

		Added support for multiple tables with DB relations.
		Tablenames will be used as a prefix for the uid based on TCA settings then.
		If the record omits the prefix for the first table this is recognized too.

		If the label field for a DB relation is a select type itself using labels from an items array, 
		these labels are used instead of the original values now.

 0.3.0		"Make query" now recognizes the following TCA field types:
 				input (number, date or text)
 				check (boolean or multiple)
 				radio (multiple)
 				select (multiple or relation)
 				group (files or relation)
 				user, flex, passthrough, none, text (text)
 			Options for the types:
 				boolean (selectbox isTrue/isFalse)
 				multiple (selectbox using the original labels for the items)
 				relation (selectbox using labels taken from the corresponding table)
 				files (selectbox using filenames taken from the corresponding upload folder and all file extensions available)
 			TODO:
 				Use of correct MM relations where necessary
 				Multilanguage labels for the Backendform 
 
 0.2.4		Added a new icon 
 
 0.2.3		Fixed some naming errors
  
 0.2.2		Fixed a bug with the main menu

 0.2.1		Fixed a bug "missing comma while using multiple DB mounts"
  
 0.2.0		Removed some debug output and updated the code with extdeveval 
 
 0.1.0		Initial version based on t3lib_fullsearch which is used in DB check. 
			Now working as a Web module for non admins too. 
			Respects the DB mounts and other security settings for BE users 
			to avoid searching in restricted areas. 
			Corrected the handling of "OR" by setting some default brackets.
